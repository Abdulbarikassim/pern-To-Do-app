# Pern To-Do Application

## Overview

The **Pern To-Do Application** is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using the PERN stack. This application allows users to manage their to-do tasks efficiently with a modern web interface and robust backend.

## Stack

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database used to store and manage application data.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used here to create a dynamic and responsive frontend.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used to run the backend server and handle API requests.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks with titles and descriptions.
- **Read Tasks**: View a list of all existing tasks.
- **Update Tasks**: Edit existing tasks to modify titles and descriptions.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
